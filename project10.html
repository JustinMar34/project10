        <h1>HANNIBAL- THE BATTLE OF CANNAE</h2>
        <p>
         After defeating the Romans at the Battle of Lake Trasimene, Hannibal now moved
         forces down south. There was panic in Rome and Quitus Fabius Maximus was appointed 
         dictator to deal with Hannibal. Fabius, however refused to meet Hannibal in the open
         field and this strategy  became highly unpopular in Rome. Romans were used to attacking, 
         not hiding. The Romans were forced to go on the offensive after Hannibal positioned
        his forces between Rome and it's vital grain supply. This setup the epic Battle of Cannae.
        Here Hannibal defeated the Romans inflicting the worst single day defeat in Rome's history
